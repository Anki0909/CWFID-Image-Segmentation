# CWFID-Image-Segmentation
Crop Weed Field Image Data-set (CWFID) contains 60 on-field images of carrot crop alongside some weeds. The objective of this project is to identify and segment the crop, weeds and the background from the given image. I have used few of semantic segmentation model for this purpose in this project.

The Crop/Weed Field Image Dataset (CWFID) accompanies the following publication: "Sebastian Haug, JÃ¶rn Ostermann: A Crop/Weed Field Image Dataset for the Evaluation of Computer Vision Based Precision Agriculture Tasks, CVPPP 2014 Workshop, ECCV 2014"

This dataset comprises field images, vegetation segmentation masks and crop/weed plant type annotations. The paper provides details, e.g. on the field setting, acquisition conditions, image and ground truth data format.
